# Bitcoin Basics

## A tutorial from Blockchain@UBC by Tayl0r... something



Get Copay wallet [here](https://copay.io/#download), or look for some other...

Get testnet coins from the [faucet](https://testnet.manu.backend.hamburg/faucet).

These Javascript files basically function as your own wallet, which Copay provides a UI for (and is much easier to manage).

`npm install bitcoinjs-lib` for the [bitcoinjs-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoinjs-lib) dependency

[bitcoinjs-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoinjs-lib)

[bitcoinjs-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoinjs-lib)

`node address.js` generates wallet private/public key pairs

`node transaction.js` generates transaction hashes that must be [pushed to testnet](https://tbtc.blockr.io/tx/push)/ the [real Bitcoin network](https://blockchain.info/pushtx)

If you get [bitcore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcore)  or [BitcoinCore](https://bitcoin.org/en/download), its like downloading the whole network/ have your own node to push to... idk much and its way too big so nah :stuck_out_tongue:

Oh yeah this is all on the testnet (not real Bitcoin), so theres no worth taking my wallet addresses I left in code.
